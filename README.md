# Music Streaming Service Implementation via Linked Lists
  Implementing a circular doubly linked list data structure, in which each node will contain the data and two pointers to the previous and the next nodes. The linked list data structure will include a head pointer that points to the first node of the linked list. The details of the structure are explained further in the More-Information.pdf . Then, this specialized linked list structure is used to implement a music streaming service application.
